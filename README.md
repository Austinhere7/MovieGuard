# MovieGuard

MovieGuard is a movie anti-piracy monitoring website designed to detect and report unauthorized online leaks of newly released theatrical movies across publicly accessible websites.

The system is intended to continuously monitor known piracy sources for movie-related metadata and flag potential piracy incidents shortly after official theatre releases.

## ⚠️ Project Status

This project is currently **under development**.

MovieGuard is my **dream project**, and it is still **unfinished**. I am actively building and improving it step by step.

## About the Project

MovieGuard aims to help identify potential piracy activity early by:

- Tracking newly released theatrical movie titles
- Monitoring publicly accessible websites for suspicious leak signals
- Reporting and flagging possible piracy incidents for review

## Vision

The long-term goal is to build a reliable early-warning platform that supports anti-piracy efforts through timely detection and structured reporting.

## Note

As this project is still in progress, features and implementation details may change over time.
